## Introduction ##
This standalone number formatter is intended to be short and fast. As they are the main factors for a high performance JavaScript app. [Development release is as short as 75 lines](http://code.google.com/p/javascript-number-formatter/source/browse/format.js#) including license info, blank lines and comments. And [production release](http://code.google.com/p/javascript-number-formatter/downloads/list#) is as small as 849 bytes.

```
alert( format( "#,##0.####", 1234567.890)); //output: 1,234,567.89
```

## Features ##
  * Short, fast, flexible yet standalone. Only 75 lines including MIT license info, blank lines & comments.
  * Accept standard number formatting like `#,##0.00` or with negation `-000.####`.
  * Accept any country format like `# ##0,00`, `#,###.##`, `#'###.##` or any type of non-numbering symbol.
  * Accept any numbers of digit grouping. `#,##,#0.000` or `#,###0.##` are all valid.
  * Accept any redundant/fool-proof formatting. `##,###,##.#` or `0#,#00#.###0#` are all OK.
  * Auto number rounding.
  * Simple interface, just supply mask & value like this: `format( "0.0000", 3.141592)`

## Limitation ##
  * No prefix or suffix is allowed except leading negation symbol. So `$#,##0.00` or `#,###.##USD` will not yield expected outcome. Use `'$'+format('#,##0.00', 123.45)` or `format('#,##0.00', 456.789) + 'USD'`
  * No scientific/engineering formatting.
  * Not for date or phone formation.
  * No color control.

## Note ##
When there's only one symbol is supplied, system will always treat the single symbol as Decimal. For instance, `format( '#,###', 1234567.890)` will output `1234567,890`. To force a single symbol as Separator, add a trailing dot to the end like this: `format( '#,###.', 1234567.890)` which will then output `1,234,567`.
